## Contents
- **mlp_mnist.py**: Baseline MLP implementation for MNIST.  
- **mlp_all.py**: Extended MLP experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Tiny ImageNet.  
- **semantic_arithmetic.py**: Word embedding arithmetic experiments.  
- **semantic_arithmetic_3_Models.py**: Comparison of multiple embedding models.  
- **semantic_arithmetic_ours_ver.py**: Custom implementation for semantic arithmetic.  
- **Results**: Training logs, plots, and analysis for different datasets.  

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to explore different datasets and models (MLPs, embeddings), analyze their performance, and reflect on dataset complexity and model suitability.
